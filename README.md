# Introduction to Hadoop
A four session workshop to get started using tools in the Hadoop universe. We're going to use the Hortonworks Hadoop Sandbox.

##Objective:
The workshop series offers a brief introduction to concepts of parallel distributed computing and the Hadoop universe. Participants will learn to navigate among the various tools, and to write programs for large scale data analysis. Examples will be provided in Python and R, knowledge of the Java programming language is not required.
