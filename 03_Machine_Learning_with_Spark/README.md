# Spark Machine Learning Library

Spark has a rich library of machine learning algorithms. As the evolution of Spark continues different versions offer variations of implemented algorithms in two packages:
- spark.mllib contains the original API built on top of RDDs.
- spark.ml provides higher-level API built on top of DataFrames for constructing ML pipelines.

Documentation can be found at http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.1/mllib-guide.html for version 1.6.1. ([latest version](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html))

## Objective for this Session
We will explore some of Spark's machine learning features. In particular two tasks (to start with):
1. Use the star-ratings by Yelp users on restaurants to find out which businesses cater to the same crowd. Once we established a model that represents the users' preferences we can develop a similarity measure based on user ratings, and train a new model that expresses the similarity of restaurants based on their attributes.

2. Develop a document classifier on Yelp reviews. This could be based on star-ratings (or just good vs bad), or certain properties of the restaurants.

## Examples

- [Spark Machine Learning Introduction](https://github.com/XD-DENG/Spark-ML-Intro) provides examples for *Random Forest*, *Regression*, *k-Means*.
- Spark example files and data sets can be download from the official GitHub repository 
[apache/spark](https://github.com/apache/spark)
- Example code is stored on ARC in `/opt/apache-spark-examples/` Python code can be found in `/opt/apache-spark-examples/src/main/python/`

- The example data files are stored on the **HDFS** on ARC in `/data/apache-spark`
	Use the command
	`$ hdfs dfs -ls -R /data/apache-spark`
	to list the available files.
